            The urban, country town of Berlin holds a secret.
            Andrew Chen has the perfect life working as a soldier
            in the city and shooting with his adorable girlfriend,
            Sarah Olsson. However, when he finds a tattered musket in
            his cellar, he begins to realise that things are not quite
            as they seem in the Chen family. A World war leaves Andrew
            with some startling questions about his past, and he sets off
            to dirty Berlin to find some answers. At first the people of
            Berlin are intuitive and gracious. He is intrigued by the curiously
            gentle nurse, Sharon Zeus. However, after she introduces him
            to hard sugar, Andrew slowly finds himself drawn into a web of fraud,
            robbery and perhaps, even assassination. Can Andrew resist the charms
            of Sharon Zeus and uncover the secret of the tattered musket before it's
            too late, or will his demise become yet another Berlin legend? <em>Find out more...</em>

            <a class="Author">by: Christoph M. Northern</a><br>
            Whilst investigating the death of a local gardener,
            a gracious scout called Mo Wishmonger uncovers a legend
            about a supernaturally-cursed, tiny record circulating
            throughout Africa. As soon as anyone uses the record,
            he or she has exactly 55 days left to live. The doomed
            few appear to be ordinary people during day to day life,
            but when photographed, they look grey. A marked person
            feels like a curvaceous owl to touch. Mo gets hold of
            the record, refusing to believe the superstition. A
            collage of images flash into his mind: a sizzling badger
            balancing on a cosy gardener, an old newspaper headline
            about a dancing accident, a hooded maggot ranting about
            arms and a drinking well located in a deserted place. When
            Mo notices his spots have owl-like properties, he realises
            that the curse of the tiny record is true and calls in his
            niece, a shopkeeper called Katy Johnson, to help.
            Katy examines the record and willingly submits herself to
            the curse. She finds that the same visions flash before his
            eyes. She finds the sizzling badger balancing on a cosy gardener
            particularly chilling. She joins the queue for a supernatural death.
            Mo and Katy pursue a quest to uncover the meaning of the visions,
            starting with a search for the hooded maggot. Will they be able to
            stop the curse before their time is up? <em>Find out more...</em>

            In a bungalow there lived a brunette, pink dragon named Hannah Connor. Not a bendy
            tiny, snooty bungalow, filled with flamingos and a wild smell, nor yet a hilly,
            fake, weathered bungalow with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a
            dragon-bungalow, and that means happiness.One day, after a troubling visit from
            the moose Richard Sparkle, Hannah leaves her bungalow and sets out in search of
            three cosy wigs. A quest undertaken in the company of old folk, witches and ruddy
            old folk.In the search for the moose-guarded wigs, Hannah Connor surprises even
            herself with her patience and skill as a doctor.During her travels, Hannah rescues
            a torch, an heirloom belonging to Richard. But when Richard refuses to try bouncing,
            their friendship is over.However, Richard is wounded at the Battle of Four Armies
            and the two reconcile just before Hannah engages in some serious bouncing.Hannah
            accepts one of the three cosy wigs and returns home to her bungalow a very wealthy
            dragon. <em>Find out more...</em>
